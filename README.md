# ALX-LOW_LEVEL_PROGRAMMING

## Programming-Language - C

## Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming

This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and
algorithm track in the **Full Stack Software Engineering Program** at [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/).

I am currently learning C.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
